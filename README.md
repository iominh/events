# Upcoming events

This repo is a directory of events. Inspired by [Developer Conferences](https://github.com/MurtzaM/Developer-Conferences) and [Hackathon-Calendar](https://github.com/japacible/Hackathon-Calendar),
I'm trying to take it a step further and consolidate all events into a single repo. Why bother? Well, I keep
missing events that I never know about so this is my attempt to fixing that problem.

* [Developer Conferences](https://github.com/minhongrails/events/tree/master/conferences)
* [Hackathons](https://github.com/minhongrails/events/tree/master/hackathons)

To add a new event, please see [CONTRIBUTING.MD](CONTRIBUTING.MD).
