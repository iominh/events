# Scripts

These are some helper scripts for converting between the various data formats (mostly from JSON to Markdown)



```javascript
# Run parser that will read the parent dirs to output some json
node main.js

# Same command except through npm
npm start


```

# Debug help

Node-inspector is awesome. After installing it: 'node-debug main.js'
