# Scripts

These are some helper scripts for converting between various data formats (json + markdown)

```javascript
# Run parser that will read the parent dirs to output some json
node main.js

# Same command except through npm
npm start```

# Debug help

[Node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) is awesome. After installing it, run

```
node-debug main.js
```

and add 'debugger;' then debug stuff
