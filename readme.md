# Upcoming events

This repo is a directory of events consolidated from across the net. Why was this made? Well, I keep
missing events that I never know about so this is my attempt at fixing that problem.

* [Developer Conferences](https://github.com/minhongrails/events/tree/master/conferences)
* [Hackathons](https://github.com/minhongrails/events/tree/master/hackathons)

To add or correct an event, please see [contributing.md](contributing.MD).
